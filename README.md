**Overview of requirements to consider:**

- Classes should be compact - no longer than 150 lines!
- Methods should be compact - no longer than 10 lines!
- Classes should have a single responsibility - must be able to describe what a class 'is' in 1 sentence.
- Incorporate Modules, Inheritance, and Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).
- While refactoring all existing tests must continue to pass.
- All methods MUST have an associated test.

### Our design strategy:

- Could give an overview of the classes and why we chose to implement things the way we did (15000' approach)
- Could speak to the journey that we took (rewriting the code, etc)... what we learned and how it shaped the final product we are turning in.
- Possibly provide examples of repetitive code we were able to eliminate/consolidate.
- Where we chose to implement modules, inheritance, etc and why
- ETC!
